# Firebase Experiment Tutorial
A tutorial and example for making an experiment in jspsych that will save data to a google firebase database. The database for the project used with this experiment is closed now, and will not receive data. Be sure to use the configuration data from your own firebase project if you try implementing this example.

## Dependencies

This experiment uses Jspsych 5.0.3, found in the repository. Jspsych was created by Josh de Leeuw. More information on Jspsych can be found at [http://www.jspsych.org/](http://www.jspsych.org/) or the [Jspsych github page](https://github.com/jodeleeuw/jsPsych/).

This experiment also uses Google Firebase, which can be found on the [Google Firebase page](https://firebase.google.com/).
